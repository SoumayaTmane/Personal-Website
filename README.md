My First Website Project

-- Project Overview --
This project represents the first version of my personal website, created to introduce myself and showcase my resume. The website is designed with simplicity and functionality in mind, aiming to provide a clear view of who I am and my professional background. The website is divided into two main pages:

** Introduction Page **
A welcoming section where I introduce myself, share a bit about my background, and outline my interests.

** Resume Page ** A structured, easily navigable version of my resume, highlighting my education, experience, skills, and achievements.

-- Features --
Simple Navigation: Users can easily switch between the introduction and resume pages.

-- Tech Stack --
HTML: For structuring the content.
CSS: For styling and layout.

-- Next Steps --
This is the first version of my website, and I plan to enhance it over time by adding more sections, interactive elements, and possibly connecting it to other projects to showcase my work and growth.
